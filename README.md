IMPORTANT WARNING

CLion has bug on windows where accented words don't work as intended. This could give the user results that are not correct, even though it isn't the program's fault.
To fix this we disabled the run.proccesses.with.pty by going to Help->Find Action->Search Registry and disabling the option. If you have that problem, you need to do this on your own machine so the program can give you the intended results.
We apologize for not finding a better solution.
